NYC restaurants analysis

The project is a tool for analyzing the ratings and price levels of various restaurants in New York City. This tool utilizes the Google Places API to fetch data for different types of restaurants in New York City and analyzes their average ratings and price levels. Users can compare the ratings and price levels for different types of restaurants (such as Japanese, Chinese, American, etc.) and understand the distribution of each type of restaurant.

Note: Considering that I am using my own Google Places API key, I have hidden it. Interested users can apply for their own API key.
